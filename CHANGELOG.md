# 0.32.2

Released 2018/01/22

## Fixed

* Avoid symbol generation for pure virtual functions. [#1197][]
* Handling of `_Complex _Float128`. [#1087][]
* Regression on code generation for variadic functions. [#1216][]
* Enum code generation generates conflicting repr hint warning. [#1224][]
* Constified code generation for enums with an explicit type of `bool`. [#1145][]
* Bindgen will now call `rustfmt` directly instead of via `rustup`. [#1184][]

# 0.32.1

Released 2017/12/18

## Fixed

* When translating C/C++ `enum`s into Rust `enum`s using `rustified_enum` /
  `--rustified-enum`, properly add `#[repr(C)]` to the emitted `enum`. [#1183][]

[#1183]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/1183

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 0.32.0

Released 2017/12/08

## Added

* Added support for bit-field allocation units that are larger than 64 bits
  wide. Note that individual bit-fields within such units are still restricted
  to being no wider than 64 bits. [#1158][]

* We can now generate random C header files and test that `bindgen` can process
  them with the `quickcheck` crate. Initial support landed in [#1159][] with a
  few more additions in follow up pull requests.

## Changed

* The `bindgen::Builder::{constified_enum_module,{bitfield,rustified}_enum}`
  builder methods and their corresponding CLI flags now compare their argument
  to the C/C++ `enum`'s "canonical path", which includes leading namespaces,
  rather than its "canonical name", which does not. This is a breaking change
  that requires callers which target a namespaced C++ enum to call e.g.
  `bitfield_enum("<namespace>::<enum_name>")` rather than e.g.
  `bitfield_enum("<enum_name>")`. [#1162][]

* When a struct is packed to a smaller alignment that is still greater than one,
  `bindgen` cannot emit Rust bindings that match the input source. Before, it
  would emit `#[repr(packed)]` anyways, which packs to an alignment of one, but
  this can lead to misalignment and UB. Now, `bindgen` will detect these
  situations and convert the struct into an opaque blob of bytes with the proper
  alignment. We are eagerly awaiting support for `#[repr(packed(N))]` in
  Rust. [#1136][]

## Fixed

* There was a perfect storm of conditions that could cause `bindgen` not to emit
  any bindings if spawning `rustfmt` to format the bindings failed. This is now
  fixed. [#1112][]

* In some circumstances, `bindgen` would emit type parameters twice for
  references to template instantiations. This is now fixed. [#1113][]

* When a C/C++ struct had a field named with a Rust keyword, and `impl_debug`
  was enabled, the generated `impl Debug for ...` blocks could reference the
  field by the Rust keyword name, rather than the non-keyword field name we
  actually end up generating. This is now fixed. [#1123][]

* There was a regression in 0.31.0 where C++ template aliases to opaque types
  would sometimes not treat the aliased type as opaque. This is now
  fixed. [#1118][]

* There was a regression in 0.31.0 that could cause `bindgen` to panic when
  parsing nested template classes. This is now fixed. [#1127][]

* Unnamed bit-fields do not affect alignment of their struct or class in C/C++,
  however `bindgen` interpreted them as doing so, which could generate
  `#[repr(C)]` structs expecting to have an incorrect alignment. This is now
  fixed. [#1076][]

* When a zero-sized type was used in a bit-field, `bindgen` could
  divide-by-zero. This is now fixed. [#1137][]

* When a template parameter is used in a bit-field, `bindgen` would panic. This
  is now fixed. [#1140][]

* There was a regression in 0.31.0 where if `bindgen` was given a header file
  that did not exist, it would panic. This is now fixed, and it will instead
  properly report the error. [#1146][]

* In some cases, generated bit-field getters and setters could access memory
  beyond `self`. This is now fixed. [#954][]

# 0.31.0

Released 2017/10/27

## Added

* ðŸŽ‰ **A new `bindgen` reviewer: [@pepyakin](https://github.com/pepyakin)** ðŸŽ‰
  You can ask @pepyakin to review all your future pull requests with `r?
  @pepyakin` from now on ðŸ˜„

* Timers for seeing which phases `bindgen` is spending its time in. On the
  command line, use the `--time-phases` flag. From a builder, use the
  `bindgen::Builder::time_phases(true)` method. [#938][]

* You can now disable `#[derive(Copy)]` for all types with `--no-derive-copy`
  and `bindgen::Builder::derive_copy(false)`. [#948][]

* We now have an overview of `bindgen`'s code base and architecture for
  newcomers in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. [#988][]

* Derive `PartialOrd` with the `--with-derive-partialord` CLI flag or
  `bindgen::Builder::derive_partialord(true)` builder method. [#882][]

* Derive `Ord` with the `--with-derive-ord` CLI flag or
  `bindgen::Builder::derive_ord(true)` builder method. [#884][]

* When `PartialEq` cannot be derived because of an array larger than Rust's
  array-derive limit, `bindgen` can emit an `impl PartialEq for ...`
  block. Enable this behavior with the `--impl-partialeq` CLI flag or the
  `bindgen::Builder::impl_partialeq(true)` method. [#1012][]

* When deriving `PartialEq` for all types, you can now specify particular types
  that shouldn't `derive(PartialEq)` with the `--no-partialeq <regex>` CLI flag
  or `bindgen::Builder::no_partialeq("<regex>")` builder method. [#996][]

* Specify types that should not derive `Copy` with the `--no-copy <regex>` CLI
  flag or `bindgen::Builder::no_copy("<regex>")` builder method. This
  functionality was previously only available via comment annotations in the
  header sources. [#1099][]

* When deriving `Hash` for all types, you can now specify particular types that
  shouldn't `derive(Hash)` with the `--no-hash <regex>` CLI flag or
  `bindgen::Builder::no_hash("<regex>")` builder method. [#1105][]

* The `bindgen` users guide now has an [FAQ section][faq]! If you have any FAQ
  suggestions to put up there, please open a pull request. [#1020][]

* Added `csmith` fuzzing infrastructure. `csmith` generates random C and C++
  programs, we feed those into `bindgen` as headers to generate bindings to,
  then test that the generated bindings compile and that their layout tests
  pass. This infrastructure landed in
  [many small bits](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AA-csmith%20is%3Aclosed).

  We <3 folks who [help us find and fix issues via fuzzing][fuzzing]! *hint
  hint*

* Added experimental support for the `thiscall` ABI when targetting Rust
  nightly. [#1065][]

## Changed

* If the user does not explicitly pass a `--target` argument for `libclang`,
  `bindgen` will insert such an argument itself. See [#942][], [#947][], and
  [#953][] for details.

* C/C++ `enum`s are now translated into constants by default, rather than Rust
  `enum`s. The old behavior was a big footgun because `rustc` assumes that the
  only values of an `enum` are its variants, whereas a lot of C/C++ code uses
  random values as `enum`s. Put these two things and it leads to *undefined
  behavior*. Translating C/C++ `enum`s into Rust `enum`s is still available with
  the `--rustified-enum <regex>` CLI flag and
  `bindgen::Builder::rustified_enum("<regex>")` builder method. [#758][]

* Generated bindings are now pretty printed with `rustfmt` by default.
  Previously, this option existed, but was off by default because `syntex` did
  an OK job at pretty printing the bindings. Now that we are using `quote! {
  ... }` instead of `syntex`, we lost that pretty printing, and now rely on
  `rustfmt`. You can disable `rustfmt`ing with `--no-rustfmt-bindings` or
  `bindgen::Builder::rustfmt_bindings(false)`. See [#925][] and [#1022][] for
  details.

## Deprecated

* `bindgen::Builder::hide_type` is deprecated in favor of
  `bindgen::Builder::blacklist_type`. [#987][]

* `bindgen::Builder::whitelisted_type` is deprecated in favor of
  `bindgen::Builder::whitelist_type`. [#987][]

* `bindgen::Builder::whitelisted_function` is deprecated in favor of
  `bindgen::Builder::whitelist_function`. [#985][]

* `bindgen::Builder::whitelisted_var` is deprecated in favor of
  `bindgen::Builder::whitelist_var`. [#989][]

## Removed

* Removed the dependency on (unmaintained) `syntex`, and **build times are cut
  in half**!

  Before:

  ```
  $ cargo clean; cargo build
  <snip>
      Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 98.75 secs
  ```

  After:

  ```
  $ cargo clean; cargo build
  <snip>
      Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 46.26 secs
  ```

  [#925][]

* The `BindgenOptions` type is no longer public. It had been deprecated in
  previous releases. Use `bindgen::Builder` instead. [#1000][]

## Fixed

* Under certain conditions, a globally scoped `enum` could end up with bindings
  in the wrong namespace module. [#888][]

* Blacklisted types were incorrectly assumed to always be `Copy`able (and
  assumed to implement other traits as well). `bindgen` is now conservatively
  pessimistic about the traits that blacklisted types implement. [#944][]

* When bitfields have a ridiculously large number of bits (for example,
  `unsigned : 632;`) then `bindgen` was incorrectly deriving traits that
  couldn't be derived, resulting in errors when compiling the bindings, and was
  also generating `struct`s with an incorrect layout. Both issues have been
  fixed. [#982][]

* `_` is a valid identifier in some C++ contexts, but can't be referenced in
  Rust, as it is the "throwaway identifier" (a term I just made up, if you use
  it now, then you owe me money). `bindgen` will now translate `_` into `__` so
  that it can be used on the Rust side. [#1008][]

* Nested class definitions were sometimes being emitted in the wrong namespace
  module in the generated bindings. [#1048][]

* `bindgen` was mis-handling `union`s that contained bitfield members. This has
  been fixed. [#744][]

* Unsigned constants that were greater than `u32::MAX` were being mis-translated
  by `bindgen`. This is now fixed. [#1040][]

* When given a directory as an input file, or a file to which we don't have read
  permissions, then `bindgen` will print a more useful error message
  now. [#1029][]

* `bindgen` previously attempted to derive `Hash` for structures with
  flexibly-sized array members, but knowing how many elements exist in such
  arrays requires program-specific knowledge that `bindgen` cannot
  have. [#1094][]

# 0.30.0

Released 2017/08/28

## Added

* Explicit control over choosing which Rust version (specific stable versions or
  nightly Rust) to target. This defaults to the latest stable Rust
  version. [#832][]

```rust
bindgen::Builder::default()
    .rust_target(bindgen::RustTarget::Stable_1_19)
    // or `.rust_target(bindgen::RustTarget::Nightly)` to use unstable features
```

or

```
$ bindgen --rust-target 1.19
# or `--rust-target nightly` to use unstable features
```

* Started adding `derive(Copy)` for large arrays of `Copy` things, even when the
  array is too large to `derive(Clone)` because Rust doesn't implement `Clone`
  for arrays of length greater than 32. [#874][]

* `bindgen` can now determine which types are hashable and add `derive(Hash)` to
  those types that support it. This is disabled by default, but can be enabled
  via `bindgen::Builder::derive_hash` or `--with-derive-hash`. [#876][]

* `bindgen` can now generate `impl Debug for Blah` trait implementations for
  types that contain non-`Debug` types, and therefore cannot
  `derive(Debug)`. This behavior can be enabled with
  `bindgen::Builder::impl_debug` and `--impl-debug`. [#875][]

* `bindgen` can now invoke `rustfmt` on the generated bindings. The bindings
  have historically been fairly pretty printed, but sometimes this is not the
  case, especially with the new `impl Debug for Blah` feature. Have `bindgen`
  run `rustfmt` with `bindgen::Builder::rustfmt_bindings` and
  `--rustfmt-bindings`, and use non-default `rustfmt` configuration files with
  `bindgen::Builder::rustfmt_configuration_file` and
  `--rustfmt-configuration-file`. [#900][]

* `bindgen` can now determine which types can be compared with `==` and add
  `derive(PartialEq)` to those types that support it. This is disabled by
  default, but can be enabled via `bindgen::Builder::derive_partialeq` or
  `--with-derive-partialeq`. [#878][]

* Additionally, `bindgen` can also add `derive(Eq)` to those types which we
  determined we could `derive(PartialEq)` and do not transitively contain any
  floats. Enable this behavior with `bindgen::Builder::derive_eq` or
  `--with-derive-eq`. [#880][]

## Changed

* Started emitting Rust `union`s when targeting stable Rust >= 1.19, not just
  unstable nightly Rust. [#832][]

* Emitted layout `#[test]`s no longer contain internal IDs for template
  instantiations including pointers and arrays. This should make generated
  bindings more stable across updates to unrelated parts of the input
  headers. [#871][]

* Determining whether a type can derive `Copy` or not was ported from an ad-hoc
  algorithm to our fix-point framework. [#766][]

* Determining whether a type has a destructor or not was also ported from an
  ad-hoc algorithm to our fix-point framework. [#927][]

## Deprecated

* `bindgen::Builder::unstable_rust`/`--unstable-rust` is deprecated, in favor of
  targeting explicit Rust versions with
  `bindgen::Builder::rust_target`/`--rust-target` instead. [#832][]

## Fixed

* Fixed a regression in the `derive(Default)` analysis that resulted in some
  opaque types deriving `Default` when they shouldn't have. [#889][]

* Fixed a regression where template instantiation layout `#[test]`s were being
  generated with invalid Rust identifiers. [#906][]

# 0.29.0

Released 2017/07/31

## Added

* ["Constified enum modules"](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/741)
  translating C/C++ `enum`s into constants within a module for namespacing,
  rather than mangling the name of the generated constants.

  For example, it turns this:

  ```c++
  // bindgen-flags: --constified-enum-module PetKind

  enum PetKind {
      Doggo,
      Kitty,
      Hamster
  };

  struct Pet {
      PetKind kind;
      char* noise;
  };
  ```

  Into this:

  ```rust
  /* automatically generated by rust-bindgen */

  pub mod PetKind {
      pub type Type = ::std::os::raw::c_uint;
      pub const Doggo: Type = 0;
      pub const Kitty: Type = 1;
      pub const Hamster: Type = 2;
  }
  #[repr(C)]
  #[derive(Debug, Copy)]
  pub struct Pet {
      pub kind: PetKind::Type,
      pub noise: *mut ::std::os::raw::c_char,
  }
  ```

  The default translation strategy for `enum`s will generate constants with
  names like `PetKind_Hamster` instead.

  Use `bindgen::Builder::constified_enum_module` or `--constified-enum-module`.

* You can now
  [mark particular template instantiations as "opaque"](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/773),
  so that `bindgen` emits a blob of bytes with the correct size and alignment
  rather than creating generic Rust types. This is useful as a workaround for
  when a template has a specialization for the given type arguments, which
  `bindgen` does not yet support. Previously, it was all of a templates'
  instantiations would be opaque or none of them would be. Use
  `bindgen::Builder::opaque_type("SomeTemplate<Foo, Bar>")` or `--opaque-type
  "SomeTemplate<Foo, Bar>"`.

* Added the ability to
  [preprocess and dump](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/812)
  the input headers given to `bindgen` to a file. This should make creating
  reproducible, system independent, standalone test cases much easier! Bring on
  the new issues! Use `bindgen::Builder::dump_preprocessed_input` or
  `--dump-preprocessed-input`.

* We now use a fix-point analysis to determine whether any given type can derive
  `Debug`, or whether it has an explicit virtual table pointer. Previously we
  were using an ad-hoc algorithm that had at various times suffered from things
  like going into infinite loops when coming across cycles. Hopefully those
  kinds of bugs are a thing of the past!
  [#767](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/767)
  [#765](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/765)

## Changed

* The `bindgen` repository has moved under the `rust-lang-nursery` umbrella! The
  new repository URL is https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen ðŸŽ‰

## Fixed

* No longer generating layout tests for template instantiations using type
  arguments that we didn't generate bindings for (which then caused compilation
  errors). [#679](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/769)

* Fixed function name mangling when cross compiling bindings for
  iOS. [#776](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/776)

* Don't include parent `inline namespace`s' names in types' names. Names of
  types from some STLs were showing up like `std___cxx11_basic_string` when they
  should have been
  `std_basic_string`. [#789](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/789)

* Fixed a bug where we wouldn't generate type definitions for some types
  referenced by an opaque type's methods, causing compilation
  errors. [#807](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/807)

* Fixed function name mangling issues for win32
  targets. [#819](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/819)

* Fixed a bug where `bindgen` was generating a generic type alias that didn't
  use its type parameter, which is illegal Rust code and caused compilation
  errors. [#820](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/820)

* The generated size, alignment, and field offset unit tests now have stable
  names rather than sometimes including an internal identifier which is
  inherently unstable. This was causing unnecessary diffs when folks were
  checking in new versions of bindings into their VCS.
  [#394](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/394)

* Fixed a bug where we would try and `derive(Debug, Default)` on structs that
  had padding like `[u8; 33]`, which is larger than the largest array length for
  which Rust will derive traits. This would cause compilation errors when
  compiling the emitted bindings.
  [#648](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/648)
